# F1-23-Trainer
F1 23 Trainer made by merika.

## How It Works?

This tool uses my [memory.dll library](https://github.com/szaaamerik/memory.andy.dll) to perform signature scans for different functions.<br/>
The result from the scans is then used to create detours to power the features within the tool.

## How do I get started?

To get started with the AIO you have two ways.<br/>
You either download the latest release or build the project yourself.

### Downloading the latest release:

- Head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/szaaamerik/F1-23-Trainer/releases),
- Find the release which has the "latest" tag and open it,
- Scroll down to the assets part, and download the executable.

### Building the project yourself:

- Clone the repository,
- Open it in your preferred dotnet IDE,
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed,
- Press the start/run button to start the project.
